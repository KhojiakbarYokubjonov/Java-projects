heuristic: cost = 3.396930754184723, 0 milliseconds
mine: cost = 1.356677532196045, 20 milliseconds
backtrack: cost = 1.356677532196045, 1427 milliseconds

The heuristic approach has the shortest runtime since it 
only finds one possible path while the other two functions 
find multiple paths and return the most efficient one. In my 
variation, I have improved the backtracking approach. Thus, 
it has a better performance since it stops the recursion 
when the current cost is higher than the existing minimum cost.
