This program implements a word search on the given grid that contains 
individual letters represented as Strings. A word can occur as any path from the first
letter to the last where a step in the path can go up, right, down, or left. (No diagonals).
Also, it is possible for the same letter to be used more than once in the same word.
The program uses a BFS algorithm to find the first character in the word. Then, it uses a DFS
to search for the word itself.
The output for this search will be a String representation of the locations in the path
as shown below.
Examples:
ARIZONA: (0, 0)(1, 0)(2, 0)(2, 1)(1, 1)(0, 1)(0, 0)
UNIVERSITY: (6, 3)(5, 3)(5, 4)(5, 5)(6, 5)(7, 5)(7, 4)(7, 3)(8, 3)(8, 4)
WILDCATS: (9, 0)(8, 0)(8, 1)(7, 1)(7, 2)(8, 2)(9, 2)(9, 1)
