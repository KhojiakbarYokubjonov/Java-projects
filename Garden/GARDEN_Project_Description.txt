This program implements a text-based simulator of a garden. 
The simulation will read commands like PLANT, PRINT, GROW, and HARVEST 
from a file and execute those commands. The garden will consist of a number of 
rows and columns of plots. Within each plot there can exist a single plant, 
which is represented with a 5x5 grid of cells. Plants are divided up into three 
different categories: TREES, FLOWERS, and VEGETABLES, all of which have unique characteristics. 
For example, trees grow up, vegetables grow down, and flowers bloom as they grow.
