# Shellsort + QuickSort + GridSort
This project has three parts:
- The first part implements a version of Shellsort
- The second part implements a sorting method for an array wrapper class
- The third part sorts a grid (a 2D array)

Part 1: A `shellSort` method that takes an Array parameter and sorts it. `(Runtime: ~O(NlogN))` <br/>
Part 2: A `quickSort` method that takes an Array parameter and sorts it. `(Runtime: ~O(NlogN))` <br/>
Part 3: A `sorting` algorithm that sorts a grid using a quickSort. `(Runtime: ~O(NlogN))`
